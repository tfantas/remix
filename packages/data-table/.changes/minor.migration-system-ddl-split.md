BREAKING CHANGE: Rename adapter DML contracts to `DataManipulationOperation`/`operation`, add first-class `DataMigrationOperation` DDL contracts, introduce the new migration system (`remix/data-table/migrations`) with `createMigration`, chainable `column` builders, schema/table planners, registry APIs, runner APIs, and optional Node file discovery from `remix/data-table/migrations/node`, and add a shared internal SQL operation compiler consumed by the official adapters.

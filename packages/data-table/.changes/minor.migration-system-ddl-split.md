BREAKING CHANGE: Rename adapter DML contracts to `DataManipulationOperation`/`operation`, add first-class `DataMigrationOperation` DDL contracts, introduce the new migration system (`remix/data-table/migrations`) with `createMigration`, chainable `column` builders, schema/table planners, registry APIs, runner APIs, and optional Node file discovery from `remix/data-table/migrations/node`, keep SQL compilation adapter-owned with shared helpers at `remix/data-table/sql-helpers`, and rename the top-level table-definition helper from `createTable(...)` to `table(...)`.

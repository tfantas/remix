Add the new host `mix` prop and mixin authoring APIs in `@remix-run/component`.

New exports include:

- `createMixin`
- `MixinDescriptor`, `MixinHandle`, `MixinType`, `MixValue`
- `on(...)`
- `ref(...)`
- `css(...)`

This enables reusable host behaviors and composable element capabilities without bespoke host props.

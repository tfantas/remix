BREAKING CHANGE: Update the mysql adapter to the split DML/DDL contract (`execute` for `DataManipulationOperation`, `migrate` for `DataMigrationOperation`), rename request payload field `statement` to `operation`, move SQL compilation to the shared internal operation compiler from `@remix-run/data-table`, and keep adapter-level migration locking support.

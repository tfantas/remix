Add support for executing both data manipulation operations and data migration
operations in the mysql adapter (`execute` for `DataManipulationOperation`,
`migrate` for `DataMigrationOperation`), including adapter-level migration
locking support.

SQL compilation remains adapter-owned while sharing common helpers from `remix/data-table/sql-helpers`.
